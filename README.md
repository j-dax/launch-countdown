- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Always helpful in understanding edge cases or expanding on other aspects (re: tailwind plugins)
- [Mozilla Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - Mozilla is incredible in showing how things work. This project utilizes some aspects of CSS that I haven't needed before (re: animations and transitions).
